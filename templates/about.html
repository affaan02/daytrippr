<h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">About Daytrippr</h1>
<p class="text-slate-600 mb-4">
  Daytrippr was built with one simple idea: travel doesn’t have to be expensive or complicated.
  Sometimes the best adventures happen in a single day — morning flight out, evening flight back.
</p>
<p class="text-slate-600">
  This MVP currently uses mocked flight data. In the future, we’ll integrate with real flight APIs so you can instantly book.
